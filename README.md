# PR-Disaster-Tweets: Analysis of Public Perception and Media Coverage During Natural Disasters in Puerto Rico

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing public perception and media coverage during natural disasters in Puerto Rico, with a particular emphasis on Hurricane Maria (2017), the 2020 earthquakes, and 2025 tsunami advisory events. The analysis combines multiple datasets, including HumAID, ISCRAM18, and custom-scraped datasets, to provide insights into disaster response patterns, public sentiment, and humanitarian needs.

## Dataset Details

### `/datasets/HumAID_maria_tweets/`
Contains annotated disaster data (hurricanes and earthquakes) from the [CrisisNLP HumAID Dataset (ICWSM 2021)](https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset). This dataset includes approximately 7,300 tweets categorized into humanitarian themes and serves as the foundation for supervised thematic classification. Subcategories include:
- Caution and advice
- Displaced people and evacuations
- Infrastructure and utility damage
- Injured or dead people
- Not humanitarian
- Other relevant information
- Requests or urgent needs
- Rescue volunteering or donation effort
- Sympathy and support

### `/datasets/ISCRAM_maria_tweets/`
Includes files from the [ISCRAM 2018 dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05144) on Hurricane Maria. It contains approximately 1,000 tweets with tweet IDs. Since original dataset only contained tweet ID's, text was retrieved via hydration with [twikit](https://github.com/d60/twikit) to analyze public perception during the event. Visualizations include:
- Engagement metrics
- Likes distribution

### `/datasets/PR_Earthquake_Tweets_Jan2020/`
A custom collection of tweets related to the **January 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico**. This dataset includes approximately 300 tweets and enables comparisons between past disasters and current social media reactions. Data was scraped using [Octoparse](https://www.octoparse.com/) with filters for keywords, dates, and geolocation. Visualizations include:
- Interaction metrics
- Language distribution
- Likes distribution
- Tweet length histograms and boxplots
- Word clouds

### `/datasets/PR_Advisory_Tweets_Feb_2025/`
A custom collection of tweets related to the **February 2025 tsunami advisory**. This dataset includes approximately 250 tweets. It enables comparisons between past disasters and current social media reactions. Data was scraped using [Octoparse](https://www.octoparse.com/) with filters for keywords, dates, and geolocation. This dataset will be processed for sentiment analysis and misinformation detection. Visualizations include:
- Engagement metrics
- Language distribution
- Likes distribution
- Tweet length histograms and boxplots
- Word clouds

## Running the Analysis

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcoyuuu/PR-Disaster-Tweets.git
cd PR-Disaster-Tweets
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üìò Jupyter Notebook (Unified Analysis)

A consolidated notebook, **`PR-Disaster-Tweets.ipynb`**, is available at the root of the project. This notebook brings together all analysis scripts and documentation in a single, executable format.

#### To run the notebook:

1. **Navigate to the project directory** (if not already there):
   ```bash
   cd PR-Disaster-Tweets
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required packages** (if not yet installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open `PR-Disaster-Tweets.ipynb` in the browser interface or in IDE if possible and run the cells interactively to explore all datasets and visualizations in one place.

> This notebook is ideal for demonstrations, walkthroughs, and academic presentations of the entire project pipeline.
> It is also available as pdf 'PR-Disaster-Tweets.pdf'.

## Project Context

Puerto Rico is highly vulnerable to hurricanes and earthquakes. While these events differ in nature, both generate significant media impact and intense social media responses. Public perception, misinformation spread, and emotional language during these events can vary greatly. This project aims to analyze and compare how Puerto Ricans react to hurricanes (e.g., Hurricane Maria) and earthquakes (e.g., January 2020 earthquakes) using social media text analysis, particularly on Twitter. This comparison will help identify communication patterns and risk perception differences for various threats.
